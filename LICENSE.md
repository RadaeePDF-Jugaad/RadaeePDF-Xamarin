## *END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT*

# **Software License Agreement for RadaeePDF SDK**

Subject to the terms below (hereafter known as the "Agreement"), "Radaee" (the joint venture company created by Radaee Studio \- a Chinese company based in Beijing \- and Jugaad s.r.l. \- an Italian company based in Montecchio Emilia, Via Luigi Reverberi 30/A, 42027, province of Reggio Emilia) hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license for the use of the RadaeePDF SDK software library (hereafter known as the "Software") and its derivatives.

This EULA applies to the product RadaeePDF SDK.

|  |
| :---- |

## **1\. GRANT OF LICENSE**

### **1.1 Development and Internal Use**

It is permitted to use the Software for development and internal purposes free of charge and without any limitation on the number of developers. For development and testing purposes across multiple environments, separate Not-For-Resale (NFR) licenses must be obtained, as detailed in Section 13\.

### **1.2 Distribution Rights**

Distribution of the Software in your applications is permitted only with a valid license.

**Internal Sharing:** It is permitted to share the full SDK package within your company or working team.

**External Distribution:** No other distribution—whether transmitted via email, physical media, website, or other electronic delivery system—is allowed without a license.

### **1.3 Backup Rights**

It is permitted to make copies of the Software specifically for backup or archival purposes.

### **1.4 SDK Versions**

This EULA applies to each version of the SDK (RadaeePDF Classic SDK, RadaeePDF Master SDK, formerly RadaeePDF SDK), hereafter collectively known as "THE SDK".

### **1.5 Unlicensed and Demo Usage**

Applications using unlicensed or demo versions of THE SDK:

a) **Permitted Use:** Shall be used only for development, testing, and/or demonstration purposes.

b) **Technical Limitations:** Unlicensed versions impose limits on certain APIs and display a Standard Watermark. Removal or alteration of the watermark in unlicensed versions is strictly prohibited.

c) **Public Store Publication:** If published on public stores (e.g., Google Play, Apple App Store), the application description must explicitly state that it is a "Demo" or "Test" version using RadaeePDF technology.

d) **Recommendation:** Users are strongly advised to use the activation key included in the demo project and perform initial testing without modifying the original demonstrative package name/bundle ID to be eligible to test every functionality and API of the SDK.

e) **Commercial Distribution:** Developers can distribute, publish, and sell commercial applications only containing licensed copies of THE SDK.

### **1.6 License Scope**

Each license allows the distribution of the Software within one (1) specific application (identified by a unique Package Name, Bundle ID, or UUID) on one (1) specific Operating System (Platform).

* Use on a second platform (e.g., porting from Android to iOS) requires a separate license.  
* Use in a second application requires a separate license.

### **1.7 Application Distribution**

Licensees can include THE SDK in their application publicly distributed through public marketplaces (such as the Apple App Store, Microsoft Store, Google Play, and others).

**Restrictions:**

* It is not permitted to distribute generated binaries via private repositories, storages, and/or marketplaces without an OEM-like license (see Section 1.11).  
* It is not permitted to distribute resulting binaries as pre-loaded applications in devices (i.e., built-in as a system app, OEM app, ODM app, etc.) without an OEM-like license (see Section 1.11).

### **1.8 Self-Contained Applications**

Each license is tied to a single self-contained application running on a single operating system. The RadaeePDF Classic SDK or RadaeePDF Master SDK software library, Java code, and/or activation key cannot be included in any external plugins, software modules, or printer drivers (i.e., via Android intent mechanisms).

### **1.9 Activation Key & Generation**

The License is linked to an Activation Key derived from the application's unique identifier.

a) **Access:** Upon license purchase, licensees receive access to a restricted control panel to generate the activation key.

b) **Required Information:** The generation process requires the following unique identifiers:

* Android: Package Name  
* iOS: Bundle ID  
* Windows UWP: App ID

c) **Technical Implementation:** The activation key is a hexadecimal string. Validation is performed statically within the Licensee's application code. No external network validation or connectivity is required.

d) **Validity:** The key validates against the SDK version release date to enforce maintenance period restrictions (see Section 1.12).

### **1.10 Maintenance Period Rules**

a) **Duration:** The 12-month maintenance period starts strictly on the date of license purchase.

b) **Independence:** The maintenance start date is separate from, and not related to, the date of the generation of the activation key.

c) **No Extension:** The maintenance period is neither extended nor reset by delaying the key generation.

d) **Bulk/Volume Licenses:** If multiple licenses are purchased in a single transaction (Bulk Order), the maintenance period for all such licenses commences simultaneously on the date of the purchase order. It is not possible to stagger or defer the maintenance start date for individual licenses within the same order (see Section 14 for Volume Licensing).

e) **Key Generation:** Initial key generation can occur at any time after purchase. The key remains valid indefinitely for all SDK versions released during the active maintenance period.

### **1.11 OEM-like License Definition and Requirements**

An OEM-like license is required for any of the following distribution scenarios:

a) **Pre-installed Distribution:** Distribution of applications containing THE SDK in any of the following forms:

* As built-in/pre-installed applications on devices  
* As system applications  
* As original manufacturer (OEM/ODM) applications

b) **Private Channel Distribution:** Distribution through any private or restricted channels including but not limited to:

* Private marketplaces  
* Enterprise distribution through App Store or Google Play  
* Private websites  
* Email distribution  
* Cloud storage services  
* Any other non-public distribution method

c) **Pricing and Eligibility Process:**

* Interested parties must submit a formal inquiry to sales@radaeepdf.com  
* A sales manager will conduct a qualification interview to understand the intended use case, distribution scope, and deployment requirements  
* Based on this assessment, Radaee will determine eligibility for OEM-like licensing, custom pricing structure, and specific terms and limitations  
* Approved customers will receive a supplementary EULA addendum, a customized price list, and specific licensing terms tailored to their use case

**Note:** OEM-like licensing is subject to approval and is not automatically granted upon request.

### **1.12 Proper License and Version Access**

A "Proper License" is defined as a valid commercial license with a legitimate activation key, properly registered to a specific application identifier.

a) **Version Access & Maintenance Logic:**

* **Access:** The Licensee has access to any/all versions of THE SDK released during their active maintenance period.  
* **Technical Restriction:** The activation key technically limits execution to SDK versions released within 12 (twelve) months of the purchase date (or renewal date).  
* **New Versions:** Versions released after the expiry of the maintenance period require a Maintenance Renewal (and a new activation key) to function properly.

b) **Perpetual Use of Old Versions:**

* A proper license remains valid indefinitely for any/all versions released during its maintenance period.  
* Previously activated versions remain fully functional and "proper" even after the maintenance period expires.  
* **No impact on existing installations:** Expiry of maintenance does not affect applications already distributed to end-users using valid SDK versions.

### **1.13 Maintenance Renewal**

a) **Renewal:** Renewal is available via yearly subscription.

b) **Benefits:** Maintenance renewal provides a new activation key valid for the latest versions, continued access to technical support, and the right to use new features.

c) **Grace Period (Late Renewal):**

* If maintenance is not renewed by the natural expiration date, the Licensee is granted a grace period of 60 (sixty) days to renew.  
* During this period, renewal is allowed without additional penalty fees.  
* The renewal term will commence retroactively from the natural expiration date of the previous period, not from the date of payment (i.e., there is no gap in the maintenance timeline).

d) **Expiration of Renewal Rights:**

* If the 60-day grace period expires, the option to renew maintenance is permanently lost.  
* To regain access to technical support and new SDK versions, the Licensee must purchase a new full license at the current list price.

### **1.14 High-Volume Maintenance Agreements**

For Customers holding or intending to acquire a portfolio of fifty (50) or more licenses ("High-Volume Licensee"), Radaee offers special maintenance arrangements:

a) **Custom Maintenance Terms:** Special maintenance terms, custom scheduling, or volume agreements may be negotiated for maintenance renewals.

b) **Mandatory Consultation:** Prior to establishing custom maintenance arrangements, a commercial consultation is required to assess the portfolio size, support requirements, and maintenance structure.

c) **EULA Addendum:** The parties may execute a specific Addendum to this Agreement. Such Addendum may modify or supersede specific clauses related to Maintenance start dates, SLA targets, and renewal terms to suit the High-Volume relationship.

d) **Contact:** Please contact the Radaee Sales Department at sales@radaeepdf.com for specific arrangements.

**Note:** In the absence of a signed Addendum, the standard terms of this EULA, including the Maintenance Period Rules defined in Section 1.10, shall apply in full.

### **1.15 Redistribution Rights**

THE SDK, when packaged within your binary application, may be redistributed royalty-free, as long as it is produced using a licensed version of the Software.

### **1.16 Source Code Usage**

It is permitted to use, modify, and/or extract any part of the source code available in the original distribution package (i.e., demo projects that contain Java, Objective-C, or C\# code), subject to the terms in Section 6.2.

### **1.17 Delivery Channels**

SDK packages and updates are released directly through the official RadaeePDF website or via public repositories (e.g., GitHub). Radaee reserves the right to select the distribution channel at its sole discretion, generally prioritizing platforms that ensure widespread adoption and ease of use for Licensees.
